Simple flask blog with MongoDB 

My attempt to make blog with flask, MongoDB and other parts ... There is lot of work from blog design, refactoring code, optimising database queries but slowly I will try to improve it.

Few things are functional writing new posts, editing existing posts, searching in post body ( maybe it will be better to change 
or combine with searching in tags). Also below posts is disqus code for commenting .

I wrote it in python3 to set up it, you need to install flask and pymongo. Also if you have MongoDB not on localhost change connecton URI in MongoClient. Download all files and run blog.py
